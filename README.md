# MongoDB Badge Completion

## Learning Objectives

1. Describe MongoDB as a document database and where it fits in modern application architectures.
2. Compare relational (SQL) and document (NoSQL) data models at a high level.
3. Recognize when a document model may be more appropriate than a traditional relational schema.
4. Connect MongoDB concepts to healthcare-relevant data scenarios.

## Comparing SQL and NoSQL Databases in Healthcare Settings

A difference between a relational database such as SQL and a non-relational/document database such as MongoDB is their structure. In relational databases, data is stored in tables and organized into rows and columns. On the other hand, non-relational databases store data in JSON-like documents. The data is connected through embedding or referencing, making it more flexible. An example of using a non-SQL database would be appropriate for modernizing clinical trials where large amounts of unstructured data from EHRs and patient histories must be integrated. This can quickly identify potenial candidates and streamline participant selection.
